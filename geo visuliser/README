Geometry Visualiser



This is a Geometry Visualiser made using Python.
It helps users understand basic geometry by drawing shapes and calculating measurements.

Features:

Plot 2D shapes (point, line, triangle)

Plot 3D shapes (still working one)

Find distance between two points

Find area of a triangle

Find angle between two lines


 Tools Used:

Python

Matplotlib

Math module

 Conclusion:

The Geometry Visualiser makes learning geometry easier and more interactive by combining visual graphs with simple mathematical calculations.
